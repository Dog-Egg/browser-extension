This Chrome extension currently only has a "site search" feature, so it hasn't been published in the Chrome Web Store yet.

If you find this feature useful and are willing to sponsor $5 to help me publish it, I'll include your name in the thank-you section.

For now, you can download the extension from [here](https://github.com/Dog-Egg/browser-extension/releases) for local installation.
